Guess the Number Game (GuessTheNumberGame.java)
The file contains JAVA source code for Number Game which is Task 1 of my remote internship at CodeSoft as a JAVA Developer.
The Number game is an interesting game which includes 5 rounds.
A player gets 7 attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
Player gets feedback on each input like The guess is correct, too high, or too low.
if player guesses the correct number within 7 attempts then he gets +20 score in each round.
At the end of 5 rounds players score out of 100 (+20 for each round * 5 rounds) is displayed.
Player can again play the game for more fun.
